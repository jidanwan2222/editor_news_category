It’s unlikely that the drop came as a surprise to traders as the digital asset has hovered above $7,100 while trading in a tight range between $7,300 and $7,100 over the past three days. Traders now expect that Bitcoin will drop to $6,800 where the digital asset could then begin a recovery. If the $6,800 level fails to function as support then there is a strong possibility that the price could drop to $6,400 then the descending channel trendline at $6,160. For the short term, the price action appears bearish and risk-averse traders will wait for a daily close before considering a position.

52896,"Hello all Berminal users, 

This update is meant to inform you of recent changes that occurred with the Berminal platform, team and our roadmap. Hopefully, this message will provide some clarity on many of the issues community members have expressed concerns about. Let’s start with the concern that is on everyone’s mind: BERM tokens and login issues

We now have a new development team that is redesigning the Berminal platform. In our early days part of our growth model and optimization process involved distributing airdrops and rewards to incentivize user engagement. Originally the rewards process was only meant to exist as the team worked out all of the bugs from the platform and also incorporated user’s feedback and desires to the platform. BERM token rewards were never meant to be a permanent part of the Berminal platform.The cost of rewarding and withdrawing BERM tokens went beyond our control and the team was not able to afford this anymore. This led to high employee turnover and an inability to support the BERM withdrawal and conversion. 

Furthermore, in 2018, the iOS store and GooglePlay were cracking down on crypto apps due to malware, fears of illegal ICOs and other marketing policies that both companies viewed as a violation of their listing policies. This is why in mid-2018 the Berminal app was removed from the App store. We were able to relist the app without changes but later in the year, we were advised to remove the BERM rewards option in order to ensure the app could remain listed.

The new team is eager to make Berminal a better app that is more focused on delivering non-stop, high-quality crypto and blockchain content and new price tracking features instead of just distributing unlisted tokens. There are plans to develop engagement incentives for users who contribute and create value for the newly launched Berminal app but this is a point of discussion for a later date.

52862,"Hello all Berminal users, 

We are writing to inform you of recent changes that occurred with the Berminal platform, team and our roadmap. Hopefully, this message will provide some clarity on many of the issues community members have expressed concerns about. 

Let’s start with the concern that is on everyone’s mind: BERM tokens and login issues

We now have a completely new development team and have plans to thoroughly rework the Berminal platform. In Berminal’s early days part of our growth model and optimization process involved distributing airdrops and rewards to incentivize user engagement. Originally the rewards process was only meant to exist as the team worked out all of the bugs from the platform and also incorporated user’s feedback and desires to the platform. 

The BERM token rewards were never meant to be a permanent part of the Berminal platform. Under the direction of our former product manager, the cost of rewarding and withdrawing BERM tokens went beyond our control and the team was not able to afford this anymore. This led to high employee turnover and an inability to support the BERM withdrawal and conversion. 

At the time of the withdrawal option closing in 2018, the iOS store and GooglePlay were cracking down on crypto apps due to malware, fears of illegal ICOs and other marketing policies that both companies viewed as a violation of their listing policies. This is why in mid-2018 the Berminal app was removed from the App store. We were eventually able to relist the app without changes but later in the year, we were advised to remove the BERM rewards option in order to ensure the app could remain listed.

Lee said that “the SEC needs to punt the ETF until crypto becomes bigger, but demand for an ETF is monstrous.” Lee also said that in his opinion the SEC is doing a good job at protecting individuals and he cautioned that “institutions aren’t going to touch crypto if they think the SEC isn’t doing a good job.” Meanwhile, Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead believes that Bitcoin could reach $42,000 before the end of 2019 and $356,000 by 2022.

Pierce said, “We are only now (this year) starting to see the first security token exchanges in place.” Pierce predicted that 2020 will probably see a “sufficient amount of infrastructure, competitive operations, that we’re not reliant on one player in the world.” Somewhat shockingly, Pierce also said that financial products like venture funds and private equity funds will not play a significant role in cryptocurrency’s mass adoption. Pierce believes that these entities will not tokenize their current offerings as the maneuver would not lead to the creation of additional income. Pierce believes that security tokens will be used to “tokenize intellectual property like security tokens” and this will open the doors for the public to invest in various art forms like Broadway plays, record albums, and movies.

In the world of trading, fractals are simply patterns which occur repeatedly across various timeframes for an asset.

Starbust notes the similarities between this move and Bitcoin’s current market cycle which saw the asset reach a 2019 high at $13,900 then drop to $7,300 over the following months before rallying to $10,540 last week.

Electricity is much cheaper in Sichuan and the area receives an abundance of rain during a five-month-long rainy season which supports the region as China’s largest producer of hydropower. Furthermore, poor infrastructure complicates the area’s ability to export excess production and this means it is easy for crypto miners to acquire cheap electricity.

Hence, cryptocurrencies inherently make regulatory oversight a daunting task. Naturally, this poses a problem for governments and regulatory bodies. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies tend to be outlawed as a result of the demand for oversight from regulatory bodies. One solution has been for such coins to offer public unobscured transactions as well. This and other means of getting regulators and crypto enthusiasts on the same page may be the best means of ensuring progress for the privacy feature of cryptocurrencies.

He stated this during an interview for a podcast show “Off the Chain,” which was aired on October 10. 
According to Hoskinson, Bitcoin being a dominant currency, was never meant to replace the world’s financial system. He stated that it wasn’t the plan of bitcoin creators. He revealed many things during the interview, including talks about proof of work versus proof of stake.
According to him, POW systems wouldn’t survive unless they find a way to evolve. He suggested trying to find a way where the computational work of the POW system gets some form of use.
Hoskinson ended his discussion by saying that Bitcoin is the brand of all cryptocurrencies. He stated that the whole industry would fail if bitcoin collapses.

Tether’s volume eclipsed Bitcoin’s for the first time in April 2019, and the current volume averages roughly $21 billion per day.
